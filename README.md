# Exercise for part three of GEOV181

This site contains exercises for the course GEOV181, Introduction to earth science and informatics. These exercises belong to the third module of GEOV181 to process your collected rain data. You do not have to use the provided code, you can make your own, but it might be helpfull. Be aware, I added some small mistakes in the code, so you will need to read the code and fix them if you use [this code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10hCyIRhI3aKHy686H1WH3jW5z6IQMLe5?usp=sharing).

Exercise:
Collect weather data for a site in Bergen using low-cost sensors. For this exercise you will work in pairs to design and build a simple weather station to install at a (safe, secure) location of your choice in Bergen. Over the next two weeks, you will use your weather station to collect observations of rainfall at your site that you will use for analysis in the final week of the module and for your hand-in assignment.

Visualisation and analysis of the results from your home weather station and comparison of these with an equivalent period of observations from MET Norway.
